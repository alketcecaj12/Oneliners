    "#### Why learn oneliners in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "First, by improving your core Python skills, you’ll be able to overcome many of the small programming weaknesses that hold you back. It’s hard to make progress without a profound understanding of the basics. Single lines of code are the basic building block of any program. Understanding these basic building blocks will help you master high-level complexity without feeling overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you’ll learn how to leverage wildly popular Python libraries, such as those for data science and machine learning. The book consists of five one-liner chapters, each addressing a different area of Python, from regular expressions to machine learning. This approach will give you an overview of possible Python applications you can build, as well as teach you how to use these powerful libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you’ll learn to write more Pythonic code. Python beginners, especially those coming from other programming languages, often write code in un-Pythonic ways. We’ll cover Python-specific concepts like list comprehension, multiple assignment, and slicing, all of which will help you write code that’s easily readable and sharable with other programmers in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, studying Python one-liners forces you to think clearly and concisely. When you’re making every single code symbol count, there’s no room for sparse and unfocused coding."
